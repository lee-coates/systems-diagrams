# The Ins & Outs of Systems Diagrams
You've identified all the pieces. You've talked with all the stakeholders. You've taken *copious* notes. You've even structured a wiki that could help your team realize all the benefits of a thriving documentation repository. It seems like such a win! But...the system is so big--there are too many details for one person to put in the wiki, and even if you could--what if no one uses it. Somehow, the whole team is going to have to get engaged with the documentation.

Detachment from documentation is common for teams working on technical projects, but there is a tool that can help--the **Systems Diagram**. Readers of this repo will see examples of how a collaboratively-built Systems Diagram can encourage a team to care more about documentation. It covers how to facilitate a Collaborative Design Session so everyone has a deeper understanding of the system and feels more compelled to keep documentation up to date. There will be a showcase of good and *"less helpful"* Systems Diagrams along with some key takeaways about how to connect this work to other documentation, workflows, and more! Keep reading to amplify your Diagramming Skills or simply to enjoy the captivating ways a Systems Diagram can illustrate meaning.
