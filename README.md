# The Ins & Outs of Systems Diagrams
1. Core Message
    - A collaboratively built Systems Diagram is the best way to get a Team to engage with Documentation.
2. Determine what is unintuitive about the core message
    - A System's Diagram Value is based more on the Facilitator's ability to coordinate the group's understanding of the problem and solution than a Designer's ability to create shapes a certain way on the page. 
3. Use unintuituve concept to break audience's Guessing Machines
    - Guessing Machine: how do I connect the dots in a way that makes sense to everyone
    - break it: the Systems Diagram Facilitator must resist filling out the diagram themselves
4. Help audience rebuild Guessing Machines with new schema
    - Facilitators must focus on helping the subject matter experts represent information flows in plain language.
    - Oftentimes, the only shapes a good Systems Diagram needs are Rectangles and Arrows.
    - Spending time at the beginning determining something as simple as where the Systems Diagram lives can have as big an impact as spending hours figuring out the details of a specific workflow.
